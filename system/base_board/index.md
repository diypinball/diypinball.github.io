The base board is the workhorse of the DIYPinball system. It provides control for:

* Eight solenoids
* Sixteen lamps
* Sixteen switches
* Sixteen RGB LEDs (on later versions)

Currently, there are three versions of the base board:

* [Base Board 1.0](base_board_version_1), based on the LPC11C24 microcontroller
* Base Board 2.0, based on the STM32F072 microcontroller
* Base Board 3.0, based on the STM32F072 microcontroller (still under development)
