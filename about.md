# What's all this, then?

At DIY Pinball we’re working on an as yet unnamed, open-source pinball system.

The focus of the project is to lower cost and technical barriers to make it easier and cheaper to restore or even construct your own pinball machine. We are designing, prototyping and manufacturing multiple interconnectable modules to be used in updating a pinball machine’s electronics. The modules communicate via a CANbus network with the brain of the machine: a Raspberry Pi computer.
