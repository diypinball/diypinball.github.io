Hi folks!

We’ve been a little silent lately, but we’re hoping to adjust that soon. For now, we’ve posted the hardware source files for the Base Board, Score Board and Raspberry Pi CAN board. The EAGLE schematics and layouts are available from:

We’re going to post firmware sources as soon as we can separate them from the licensed-encumbered NXP frameworks.
